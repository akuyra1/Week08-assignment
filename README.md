🎯 Created using create-next-app
    - DONE
🎯 Design a SQL schema for a posts table, and a comments table that has a post_id column connecting it to the posts table.
    - DONE
🎯 Either create a form where users can add posts OR seed your database with at least 4 posts that comments can be added to (if you do the seed, one of the stretch goals will be harder).
    - SEEDED THE DATABASE WITH TABLE EDITOR WITH4 POSTS.

Stretch Goals
🏹 Add a categories table to allow categorisation of posts at creation time using a dropdown menu. Add a /categories route that lists all categories, and a /categories/:id route that lists all posts in a category.

🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
    - I have achieved most of the requirements, unsure about the last one with static/dynamic data.
    - Managed to design SQL schema to connect each comment to each post and display it to the user when comment submit button is clicked.
    - Each post has its own page where each page has its own comment form which is connected to database.


🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
    - Did not attempt any of the stetch goals.


🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
    - Seems I struggle remembering all information from lessons and how to connect all the lessons together.
